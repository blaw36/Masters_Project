# Masters_Project

This research project is part of the requirements of the Masters of Science (Mathematics and Statistics) at The University of Melbourne. This repo will (attempt to) keep track of all my readings, notes, codes and findings I make as part of my research project (in a nice, readable, webpage), spanning across three semesters (July 2018 - December 2019).

See the [webpage] (https://blaw36.github.io/Masters_Project/).

Also, you can email me at `bklaw@student.unimelb.edu.au`.

Other information:
* The project will be about <blah>
* The official thesis title is <blah>
* My supervisor is [Heejung Shim](https://http://heejungshim.org)
* I guess that means this project is within the realms of the [Melbourne Integrative Genomics (MIG) group](https://research.unimelb.edu.au/integrative-genomics/MIG-home)

A [workflowr][] project.
