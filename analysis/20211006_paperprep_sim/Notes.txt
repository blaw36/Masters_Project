re-ran simulations as per page 39 of my thesis due to incorrect log transform. Wanted to get a feel for what impact it may have, so I re-ran the analysis for length 8, 100% strength. (The log transform issue concerns adding scaling coefficient using the same log base as the tree's logLR when running the ROC analysis).

To reproduce the sims, all I had to do was:
- Alter the R code in run_sim4_v2 function to make sure same logLRs of same log scale were added in both null and alt cases
- I ran the length 8 simulations from /code/sim4_1_4_singleLengthAnalysis_200.R. That represents the l8.RDS data saved here.
- Then I manually ran it through ch3_auroc_images.R to generate the plots.

Not much difference just by squinting at the plot. The auROCs:
old: 
noHMT 91.73
HMT 93.26

new:
noHMT 91.80
HMT 93.61

Marginal difference
