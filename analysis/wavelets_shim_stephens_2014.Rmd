### Introduction

* High-level aim: Associate observable traits/behaviours with genetic variants - genetic association studies
* Data is obtained from high-throughput sequencing assays, resulting in high-resolution data, which is not utilised by traditional association analysis methods (coarser resolution);
    + Fixed length windows
    + Genes
* Treat sequence data as measuring an underlying 'function' which varies on the genome
    + Use the high-res, wavelet-based methods for functional data analysis
* Focus in this paper is on identifying _genetic variants associated with chromatin accessibility_, using _DNase-seq_
