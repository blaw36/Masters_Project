# Template folder instructions

Folder structure as required for the .R script to run.

Go into 'batch_scripts' and run shell_gen2.sh (by going into the folder then running `./shell_gen2.sh`). This will __generate__ all the required shell scripts for the batch run.

To run the scripts, run shell_run.sh (`./shell_run.sh`) to __queue__ up all the batch jobs.
